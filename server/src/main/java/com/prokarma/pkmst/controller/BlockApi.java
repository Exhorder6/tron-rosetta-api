    @ApiOperation(value = "Get a Block Transaction", notes = "Get a transaction in a block by its Transaction Identifier. This endpoint should only be used when querying a node for a block does not return all transactions contained within it. All transactions returned by this endpoint must be appended to any transactions returned by the /block method by consumers of this data. Fetching a transaction by hash is considered an Explorer Method (which is classified under the Future Work section). Calling this endpoint requires reference to a BlockIdentifier because transaction parsing can change depending on which block contains the transaction. For example, in Bitcoin it is necessary to know which block contains a transaction to determine the destination of fee payments. Without specifying a block identifier, the node would have to infer which block to use (which could change during a re-org). Implementations that require fetching previous transactions to populate the response (ex: Previous UTXOs in Bitcoin) may find it useful to run a cache within the Rosetta server in the /data directory (on a path that does not conflict with the node).", response = BlockTransactionResponse.class, tags={ "Block", })
